# Online Document Reference with Password Security! 

## Overview :-

### This project was created to address a personal challenge I encountered frequently. Whenever I needed to access PDFs or documents on a computer that wasn't mine—such as those in a library or a computer lab—I found it inconvenient to log in to my cloud storage or other platforms just to retrieve a few files. My goal was to create a simple, secure, and efficient solution to this problem by building an online reference system for documents and PDFs that can be accessed from anywhere, at any time, with just a link and a password.

## Why I Built This :-

### As a student or professional who constantly needs to reference study materials or documents, it becomes a hassle to repeatedly log in to cloud storage services on unfamiliar computers. The process is time-consuming and not always secure. This project was my attempt to eliminate these inefficiencies and simplify the way I access important documents.

## The core motivations behind this project are : -

### ● Convenience: To have quick and easy access to important documents without the need to log in to various accounts.

### ● Security: To protect sensitive documents with a password, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.

### ● Portability: To make documents available online so they can be accessed from any device with internet connectivity, without worrying about storage limits or file compatibility.
